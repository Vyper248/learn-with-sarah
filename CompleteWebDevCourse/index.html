                <h4>Calculator</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    The Javascript section gave the task of creating a basic calculator using variables, that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. As I was already familiar with Javascript I decided to make a full calculator with the memory feature.

                <h4>Robo Friends - React App</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    This is the first React / Redux app that I created as part of the course. Very simple app that uses the robohash.org api along with jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to generate robot images. Includes search box to filter robots.

                <h4>Live HTML Editor</h4>
                <div class="projectInfo">
                    There was a video showing the basics of 'fs', so I thought I'd try making a live html editor which saves changes to the server. So any changes made are permananent and visible to everyone.
